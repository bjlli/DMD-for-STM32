# DMD-for-STM32
Freetronics DMD library (https://github.com/freetronics/DMD) adaptation for STM32 microcontrollers (using STM32CubeIDE HAL)

This example was written for a Black Pill Board (stm32f401ccu6), but you can adapt and make it work for any STM32Cube supported board just changing the microcontroller include on dmd.h.
